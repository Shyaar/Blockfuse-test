Blockfuse test- (Section 2)

After going through the questions in section 2, I have realized that it requires some level of skill and experience in programming and the tasks would involve advanced technical skills in areas such as RESTful API design, JWT authentication, SPA development, and real-time chat applications development. While I am currently not proficient in these specific skills, I am highly motivated to learn and master them through the BLOCKFUSE program. 
Iâ€™m confident that my enthusiasm and commitment to learning will help me succeed and make the most of this opportunity. Looking forward to the possibility of joining the program.
